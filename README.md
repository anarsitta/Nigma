# Nigma
Enigma is a portable encryption machine used to encrypt and decrypt secret messages. The first version of the rotary encryption machine was patented in 1918 by Arthur Scherbius. Based on the design of the original Enigma model, a whole family of electromechanical rotary machines under the same name was created, which have been used since the 1920s in the field of commercial and military communications in many countries of the world.

Rotors are the heart of Enigma. Each room has a dick approximately 10 min diameter, made of ebonite or bakelite, with spring-loaded pin contacts on the right side of the rotor, arranged in a circle. On the left side there was a corresponding number of flat electrical contacts.
The reflector is a rotor that does not scroll.

The encryption process was carried out by closing some contacts and scrolling the rotors. The "Enigma" transformation for each letter can be determined mathematically.

# Description
The software will be presented in two forms: the main form and the configuration form. It will be used by one group of users who will have all the rights to use the application.

Users of the program will be provided with the full functionality that is implemented in the application, namely downloading / unloading files, starting the encryption process, changing rotors, changing reflectors, changing the theme.

In order to encrypt messages, you need to enter the original message or download it from a file after the text appears in the data entry field, you need to click on the "Encryption" button, as a result, the application will encrypt the data by moving the rotors to the desired position. It is worth clarifying that the cipher text does not have spaces or punctuation marks, which increases its cryptographic strength.

In order to decrypt the messages, it is necessary to place the encrypted message in the field of the original message, then set the rotors to the position at which the message was encrypted, if the rotors are installed correctly, then after pressing the "Encryption" button, the decrypted original message will appear.

# Disadvantages
The key disadvantage is the inability of encryption in Russian. One of the formulas in the Russian rotor class is inoperable, which does not allow decrypting the encrypted message.

P. S. Thank you for reading and familiarizing yourself with the program.
